The following are the difference between the Python2 and Python3
1) 'print' keyword in Python2 is replaced by 'print()' function in Python3
    Python3 will give syntax error if the parentheses are not used.
    Example: Python3: print ("hello")	Python2: print "hello"
2) Division operator
    Python2 will give round off value(i.e 12/5 as 2) whereas Python3 the gives the exact decimal value(i.e 12/5 as 2.4)
3) The default storing procedure for the string is Unicode in Python3 where as in Python2 it is ASCII. Inorder to store the
    string as Unicode have to use 'u' in Python2.
4) In Error handling, python3 will make use of the 'as' keyword.
5) Python3 will not support 'xrange()' function.
